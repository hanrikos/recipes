You�re not allowed to use anything other than regular shit of the language (like string, int, for, if, class functions etc. )

 

No libraries are allowed .

 

Your input is a file, with 1 or more jsons,

the output of the program should be:

 

I got a Json:   followed by a printout of the json itself, FOR EVERY JSON you get .

 

So if I give you a file with 1 json:

The output will be:

 

I GOT a JSON:

{   json data,  json data �.  }

 

And if 2 jsons are in the file

The output should be :

 

I GOT a JSON:

{   json data,  json data �.  }

 

 

I GOT a JSON:

{   json data,  json data �.  }
